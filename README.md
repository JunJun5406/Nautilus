<p align="center">Adds a comprehensive void boss item tier, and 16 new void counterparts to vanilla/DLC items.</p>

<hr>

### Shrine of the Deep
**Void boss** items can be obtained by activating a new shrine which spawns bosses and elites as Voidtouched at a higher difficulty, potentially rewarding you by converting any boss item drops into their void equivalents. They can also be obtained by using a Trophy Hunter's Tricorn on a Voidtouched boss, or through other methods.

Not all Void Boss items are implemented yet, so enemies without one will drop their original boss item.

### Recommended mods
- [NoContentSourceMixLimit](https://thunderstore.io/package/Moffein/NoContentSourceMixLimit/) to make void content more common.
- [VanillaVoid](https://thunderstore.io/package/Zenithrium/VanillaVoid/) for even more Vanilla void conversions (Must be configured to only include one void watch/elixir from either mod).
- [VoidUnstableTransmitter](https://thunderstore.io/package/HDeDeDe/VoidUnstableTransmitter/) to make Unstable Transmitter less redundant as a void conversion of Old War Stealthkit.
- [OldFathomlessVoidling](https://thunderstore.io/package/viliger/OldFathomlessVoidling/) for a better Voidling fight and void locus experience. Also adds a Locus portal to each fifth stage.
- [CollapseDisplay](https://thunderstore.io/package/Goorakh/CollapseDisplay/) so collapse damage is easier to predict.
