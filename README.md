<p align="center">Adds a comprehensive void boss item tier, and 17 new void counterparts to vanilla and DLC items.</p>

<hr>

### Void Boss tier
These powerful versions of boss items can be obtained in various ways, but a boss must first be Voidtouched for its item to become corrupted. To help you find more of them, this mod adds one new interactable:

<p align="center" style="font-size: 1.1em;font-weight: 600">Shrine Of The Deep</p>
<p align="center">Starts spawning at Stage 2. Activating calls out to the void, spawning Voidtouched bosses and elites at the teleporter. In exchange, you receive 1 bonus item drop, and all boss item rewards are converted to their void equivalents.</p>

### Recommended mods
- [NoContentSourceMixLimit](https://thunderstore.io/package/Moffein/NoContentSourceMixLimit/) to make void content more common.
- [VanillaVoid](https://thunderstore.io/package/Zenithrium/VanillaVoid/) for even more Vanilla void conversions (Must be configured to only include one void watch/elixir from either mod).
- [VoidUnstableTransmitter](https://thunderstore.io/package/HDeDeDe/VoidUnstableTransmitter/) to make Unstable Transmitter less redundant as a void conversion of Old War Stealthkit.
- [OldFathomlessVoidling](https://thunderstore.io/package/viliger/OldFathomlessVoidling/) for a better Voidling fight and void locus experience. Also adds a Locus portal to each fifth stage.
- [CollapseDisplay](https://thunderstore.io/package/Goorakh/CollapseDisplay/) so collapse damage is easier to predict.
- [BenthicRebloomed](https://thunderstore.io/package/braquen/Benthic_Rebloomed/) for a less lunar-like experience while using Benthic Bloom, to put it on par with other Void Legendary items in terms of balance.
